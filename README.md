# Inspiration

The inspiration for Argos came from the growing frustration among software teams with daily stand-up meetings that often become repetitive and time-consuming. With remote work becoming more prevalent, teams need a more efficient way to keep track of progress without interrupting their workflow. The idea is to leverage AI to streamline project management by automating progress tracking and forecasting timelines, allowing teams to focus more on their work and less on meetings.


# How I built it
Argos was built using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) engineer and efficient data pipelines. The system integrates with popular version control systems like GitHub. Using NLP, it extracts meaningful information from commit messages and task descriptions.
