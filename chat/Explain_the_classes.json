Here's a breakdown of the key classes defined in this code snippet:\n\n### 1. VectorStoreDocument\n- **Purpose**: Represents a document that is stored in a vector storage system.\n- **Attributes**:\n  - `id`: A unique identifier for the document, which can be of type string or integer.\n  - `text`: The text content of the document, which may be `None` if not applicable.\n  - `vector`: A list of floats representing the vector representation of the document, potentially `None` if not available.\n  - `attributes`: A dictionary that can hold any additional metadata related to the document, such as title or date ranges. It defaults to an empty dictionary.\n\n### 2. VectorStoreSearchResult\n- **Purpose**: Represents the result of a search query against the vector store.\n- **Attributes**:\n  - `document`: An instance of `VectorStoreDocument` that represents the document retrieved from the storage.\n  - `score`: A float value representing the similarity score of the retrieved document based on the search query. This score is normalized between 0 and 1, with higher scores indicating greater similarity.\n\n### 3. BaseVectorStore\n- **Purpose**: An abstract base class that defines the essential operations necessary for a vector storage implementation.\n- **Constructor Parameters**:\n  - `collection_name`: Name of the collection (or database) the vector store will operate on.\n  - `db_connection`: An optional parameter for the database connection.\n  - `document_collection`: An optional parameter for the specific document collection to work with.\n  - `query_filter`: An optional filter to apply when querying documents.\n  - `**kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments for flexibility.\n  \n- **Abstract Methods**:\n  - `connect(**kwargs)`: Abstract method for connecting to the vector storage system. Each derived class should provide its implementation.\n  - `load_documents(documents: list[VectorStoreDocument], overwrite: bool = True)`: Abstract method to load a list of documents into the vector store, with an option to overwrite existing documents.\n  - `similarity_search_by_vector(query_embedding: list[float], k: int = 10, **kwargs)`: Abstract method for performing approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search using a vector embedding as the query. It returns a list of `VectorStoreSearchResult`.\n  - `similarity_search_by_text(text: str, text_embedder: TextEmbedder, k: int = 10, **kwargs)`: Abstract method for performing ANN search based on text input. It requires a text embedder to convert the text into a vector.\n  - `filter_by_id(include_ids: list[str] | list[int])`: Abstract method to create a query filter based on document IDs, allowing retrieval of specific documents.\n\n### Summary\nThese classes serve as a foundational structure for interacting with a vector storage system, where documents can be loaded, stored, and queried based on their vector representations or textual content. The use of abstract methods in the `BaseVectorStore` class suggests that this code is designed to be extended by specific implementations that connect to particular vector storage backends. Additionally, the use of data classes (`VectorStoreDocument` and `VectorStoreSearchResult`) provides a clear and concise way to manage data structures commonly found in such systems."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Report on Changes Made in `getData.py`\n\n**Date of Change:** November 9, 2023  \n**Author:** Polo280  \n**File Modified:** `src/getData.py`\n\n#### Summary of Changes:\nThe author has added a new function `getData()` to the `getData.py` file. This function is designed to retrieve and format data from various files for use in the application. Below are the specifics of the modifications:\n\n#### Detailed Changes:\n1. **Import Statements:**\n   - Added import for `evaluateAll` function from another module.\n   - Imported the `pandas` library for data handling.\n\n2. **Function Definition:**\n   - Defined a new function `getData()` that returns a Pandas DataFrame.\n\n3. **Data Collection:**\n   - Introduced arrays (`centering`, `lightning`, `orientation`, and `focus`) to store results related to different image characteristics.\n\n4. **File Indexing:**\n   - Created a predefined list, `fileIndex`, containing specific indices of files to be processed.\n\n5. **Evaluation Loop:**\n   - A for loop is implemented to iterate over `fileIndex`, calling the `evaluateAll` function for each path, and collecting results into the respective arrays.\n   - The data being collected includes characteristics like centering, lightning, orientation, and focus.\n\n6. **DataFrame Creation:**\n   - After processing the files, a Pandas DataFrame is created which consolidates the collected data with appropriate column names: 'File_Index', 'Centering', 'Lightning', 'Orientation', and 'Sharpness'.\n   - The DataFrame is then returned by the function.\n\n7. **Error Handling:**\n   - A try-except block is present to handle exceptions that may arise during execution, with exceptions being printed to the console.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe changes made to `getData.py` lay the groundwork for an organized way to gather and analyze image-related data. The new function and data structures significantly enhance the functionality of the application by enabling the processing of multiple files in a streamlined manner."}]
