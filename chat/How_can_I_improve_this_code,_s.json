Below are key enhancements you can make to achieve this:\n\n1. **Polling Mechanism**: Add a function that checks for new commits at regular intervals.\n2. **Store the Last Fetched Commit**: Keep track of the last fetched commit SHA to determine if there are new commits.\n3. **Run in a Loop**: Use a separate thread or an asynchronous loop to continuously poll for new commits.\n\nHere\u2019s an example modification to your `ContextGatherer` class with the suggested changes:\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport threading\n\nclass ContextGatherer:\n    # ... (existing code remains unchanged) ...\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, check_interval=60, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)  # Call the base constructor\n        self.check_interval = check_interval  # in seconds\n        self.last_sha = None  # Store the last commit SHA\n\n    def fetch_commits(self, owner, name):\n        \"\"\"Fetch and process commits from the repository.\"\"\"\n        token = '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'\n        # GitHub API URL for commits\n        url = f\"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{name}/commits\"\n        headers = {'Authorization': f'token {token}'}\n\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            commits = response.json()\n            # If there are commits, process them\n            if commits:\n                for commit in commits:\n                    sha = commit['sha']\n                    # If this is the first fetch or new commit\n                    if self.last_sha is None or sha == self.last_sha:\n                        break  # Exit the loop if it\u2019s the last known commit\n                    self.process_commit(commit)  # Process the commit\n                # Update the last processed SHA\n                self.last_sha = commits[0]['sha']\n        else:\n            logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch commits: {response.status_code}\")\n\n    def process_commit(self, commit):\n        \"\"\"Process an individual commit, extracting necessary information.\"\"\"\n        sha = commit['sha']\n        commit_author = commit['commit']['author']['name']\n        date = commit['commit']['author']['date'].split('T')[0]\n        message = commit['commit']['message']\n        files_changed = commit.get('files', [])\n        # ...

Adjust `check_interval` accordingly, or implement a backoff strategy if you hit the limit.\n- **Thread Safety**: Ensure that access to shared data structures (if any are added later) is thread-safe.\n\nThese changes should allow your code to monitor for new commits continuously and perform necessary actions when new commits are available."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Help me improve function \"commit_history\" so it downloads all commits without the error of only downloading certain quantity restricted by the pagination of the GithubAPI"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To modify the `commit_history` function in your `ContextGatherer` class for downloading all commits from the GitHub API without being restricted by pagination, you'll need to implement a loop that iteratively fetches all pages of commits. The GitHub API paginates results, typically returning 30 items per page by default (but you can request up to 100). \n\nHere's how you can modify the `commit_history` function to achieve that:\n\n1. Use a loop to request additional pages of commits until no more results are available.\n2. Adjust the request to specify a higher `per_page` parameter to maximize the number of commits returned in a single request.\n\nHere's the updated `commit_history` function:\n\n```python\ndef commit_history(self, owner, name):\n    token = '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'\n\n    # GitHub API URL for commits\n    url = f\"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{name}/commits\"\n\n    # Headers for authenticated requests\n    headers = {\n        'Authorization': f'token {token}'\n    }\n\n    commit_history_data = []\n    commit_history_data.append(f\"COMMIT HISTORY OF REPOSITORY: {owner}-{name}\\n\")\n\n    # Parameters for pagination\n    params = {\n        'per_page': 100,  # Maximum number of results per page\n        'page': 1         # Starting page number\n    }\n\n    while True:\n        # Make a GET request to fetch the commit history\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)\n\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            commits = response.json()\n            if not commits:  # Check if there are no more commits\n                break  # Exit the loop if no commits are retrieved\n\n            for commit in commits:\n                sha = commit['sha']\n                commit_author = commit['commit']['author']['name']\n                date = commit['commit']['author']['date'].split('T')[0]  # Extract the date part only\n                message = commit['commit']['message']\n\n                # Get the details of the commit\n                commit_url = f\"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{name}/commits/{sha}\"\n                commit_response = requests.get(commit_url, headers=headers)\n                \n                if commit_response.status_code == 200:\n                    commit_data = commit_response.json()\n                    files_changed = commit_data.get('files', [])\n                    commit_history_data.append(f\"{commit_author}, {date} : {message}\\n\")\n\n                    for file_changed in files_changed:\n                        status = file_changed['status']\n                        filename = file_changed['filename']\n\n                        commit_history_data.append(f\"    {file_changed['filename']} - {file_changed['status']}\\n\")\n\n                        if file_changed['status'] == 'renamed':\n                            code = f\"Previous filename: {file_changed['previous_filename']} - New filename: {file_changed['filename']}\"\n                        else:\n                            try:\n                                code = file_changed['patch']\n                            except:\n                                code = \"Blank File\"\n                        insert_to_db_commits(f'{self.table}_commits', commit_author, date, message, filename, status, code)\n\n                    commit_history_data.append(\"------------------------------\\n\")\n                else:\n                    commit_history_data.append(f\"Failed to fetch commit details: {commit_response.status_code}\\n\")\n            \n            # Increment the page number for the next iteration\n            params['page'] += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Failed to fetch commits: {response.status_code}\")\n            break\n\n    context = ''.join(commit_history_data)  # Combine the list into a single string for the context\n    # Add to database\n    insert_to_db(self.table, url, \"commits\", context)\n```\n\n### Changes Made:\n1. **Pagination Handling**: Added a `while True` loop that continues requesting commits until no more commits are returned.\n2. **Parameters for Pagination**: Introduced a `params` dictionary to control pagination, specifying `per_page` for maximum results.\n3. **Response Evaluation**: The loop checks if the `commits` list is empty to terminate further requests.\n\nNow, this modified `commit_history` function will gather all commits regardless of pagination limits imposed by the GitHub API."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How can I save per user the response of the LLM and don't need to ask the same query again and only show the response I saved per author"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How can I save per user the response of the LLM and don't need to ask the same query again and only show the response I saved per author"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How can I save per user the response of the LLM and don't need to ask the same query again and only show the response I saved per author"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To implement the functionality of saving responses per user and avoiding redundant queries, you can utilize `st.session_state` to store the responses after they're generated.

Here's a breakdown of its function:\n\n1. **Imports**: The file imports two functions, `clerkMiddleware` and `createRouteMatcher`, from the `astro-clerk-auth/server` package. The `clerkMiddleware` is used to handle authentication-related logic, while `createRouteMatcher` is used to define which routes require protection.\n\n2. **Route Matcher**: The `isProtectedPage` constant holds a route matcher that checks if the incoming request's URL matches the pattern `\"/user(.*)\"`. This means any route that starts with `/user` will be considered a protected page. The regex `(.*)` allows for any path that follows `/user`.\n\n3. **Exported function (`onRequest`)**: This is the main middleware function exported from the file. It takes three parameters:\n   - `auth`: An object provided by the Clerk middleware that contains authentication information and methods.\n   - `context`: An object that contains information about the request being processed.\n   - `next`: A function to call the next middleware or route handler in the request lifecycle.\n\n4. **Authentication Logic**:\n   - The function first checks if the incoming request matches the protected routes (i.e., it starts with `/user`) and whether the user is authenticated by checking if `auth().userId` is present.\n   - If the request matches a protected page and the user is not authenticated (i.e., `auth().userId` is falsy), the user is redirected to the sign-in page using `auth().redirectToSignIn()`.\n   - If the user is authenticated or if the request does not match the protected route, the middleware proceeds to call `next()`, allowing other middleware or request handlers to process the request.\n\n### Summary\nThis file defines middleware for an Astro application that protects certain routes (specifically those that start with `/user`) by enforcing authentication using Clerk. If a user attempts to access those routes without being signed in, they are redirected to the sign-in page. If they are authenticated or the request does not target a protected route, the request proceeds normally."}]
